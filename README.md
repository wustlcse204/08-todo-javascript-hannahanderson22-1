# CSE204: To-Do List App
To-Do list application for CSE204: Web Development created by Hannah Anderson. Created and published April 2020.

## About

I made myself a to-do list application where I can add tasks, check them off to mark them as complete, and delete them via AJAX in Javascript. The app uses an API key unique to me provided by my professor, so the website will remember existing tasks even if I exit out and return.
